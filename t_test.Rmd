# Test if the average age between two groups is significantly different

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```



```{r}
data <- read.csv("data/german_data_clean.csv")
```


# 

Assumed that the data is normally distributed

We use the t-test to compare the average ages


Create the two groups

```{r}
group1 <- data %>%
  filter(purpose == "car (new)")

group2 <- data %>%
  filter(purpose == "car (used)")
```

Execute the t-test

```{r}
t.test(group1$age_years, group2$age_years)
```
